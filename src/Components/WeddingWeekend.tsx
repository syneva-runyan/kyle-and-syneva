            <p>Because we don't see family and friends often, we're inviting guests to stay at Hawkesdene for an extended weekend, <strong>Thursday June 5, 2025 to Sunday June 8, 2025.</strong></p>
            <p>Wedding guests will be the only people on premise during the weekend and there will be food and activities planned for each day.</p>
            <p>We ofcourse understand if you're not able to make the whole weekend (or even not at all) but know that if you're invited, you're special to us and we consider ourselves lucky to have you in our lives.</p>
